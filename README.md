# isLeaked

## Usage
This is a quick script to check if a password has been compromized before users register on a web site. This project was inspired by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhUb5iknVJs&t=418s)
it returns the number of times that password has been leaked. Feel free to change the code and use it how you like.
